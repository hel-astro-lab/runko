Runko --- modern toolbox for plasma simulations 
==========================================================

Runko is a modern numerical toolkit for simulating astrophysical plasmas. It is written in C++17/Python3 and is designed to be highly modular. The name originates from the Finnish word *runko* meaning literally "a frame".  

To get started, follow these manual pages in order. This will get you up-to-date in the prerequisites, installation, and understanding the various algorithms. Notes and tips that focus on code development are listed at the end of the manual.


Physical modules
----------------

The framework consists of various physics modules that can be run independently or combined together to create multi-physics simulations. Different modules include:

* Finite difference time domain electromagnetic module 
* Particle-in-cell (PIC) module
* Force-free magnetohydrodynamics module 
* Relativistic Vlasov module
* Non-linear Monte Carlo Radiation module


Technical goodies
-----------------

* Uses *modern C++14/17* incl. ``std::vector``, ``auto`` keyword, etc.
* Low-level objects are binded to native *Python3* objects via `PyBind11 <https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ providing seamless operability.
* Physics modules are based on *polymorphic classes*; child classes derive their functionality from the base class, occasionally overwriting the original functionality -- no more rewriting your algorithms!
* Same algorithm is specialized to a spesific space dimension during compile time with *template metaprogramming*.
* Algorithms are designed to have abstract *interface classes*; this makes adding new implementations a breeze - just add a new file!
